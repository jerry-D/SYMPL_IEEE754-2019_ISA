# 32, 64, 128 and 256-bit SYMPL IEEE 754-2019 Instruction Set Architecture Compute Engine.

(June 18, 2021) Update:  the debugger is up and running in the ULX3S FPGA.  Still need a couple weeks to do documentation and add the disassembler. Sorry for the delay.

(April 22, 2021)  A RADIONA ULX3S FPGA project board has been purchased and efforts are underway to create 32, 64, 128 and 256-bit versions of the SYMPL IEEE 754-2019 ISA Compute Engine that implements in hardware all computational and non-computational binary32 floating-point operations mandated by the IEEE 754-2019 standard.  

For a preview of what's to come, click on the thumb of a 17" x 24" poster-size preliminary information sheet below and then the "download" button once it appears.  This repository will be continually updated with FPGA flash file that you can use to flash your ULX3S FPGA with for evaluation purposes.  To obtain your RADIONA ULX3S board, visit CrowdSupply or MOUSER Electronics.  Be sure to order the model with the -85F FPGA.  

Be advised that it will probably be another 3-4 weeks before alpha is made available here.
